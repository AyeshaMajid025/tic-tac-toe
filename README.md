# tic-tac-toe
This Python project implements Tic-Tac-Toe with an AI using the Minimax algorithm and its optimized Alpha-Beta Pruning version. It compares their performance and simulates a game between a random player (X) and the AI (O), demonstrating efficient, strategic decision-making in turn-based games.
